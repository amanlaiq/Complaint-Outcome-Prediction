# Complaint-Outcome-Prediction

Problem Statement
In a bid to build trust between the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and the communities they serve, it is crucial to understand and forecast the outcomes of civilian complaints. This project aims to construct a predictive model that uses historical complaint data to anticipate the likelihood of substantiation for new complaints. This tool seeks to assist the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) in efficiently identifying and prioritizing cases, thereby enhancing the NYPDâ€™s capacity to address potential issues preemptively and foster a safer, more transparent community environment.
