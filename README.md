# Complaint-Outcome-Prediction

Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the outcomes
of civilian complaints against New York City police officers. Every year, the Civilian Complaint
Review Board (CCRB) gets thousands of complaints ranging from excessive force to discourtesy
and conducts investigations to establish whether or not the charges are true. The findings of these
investigations have a substantial impact on the NYPD's reputation and the public's trust in law
enforcement. Implementing this project will help CCRB understand and identify cases that are
likely to result in substantiated allegations and prioritize them for investigation. It will also be
helpful to the NYPD to identify officers who are more likely to be involved in substantiated
complaints and take appropriate action to address the issue. This would help residents of NYC
trust and rely more on the police department and thereby improve the safety of the city. This
phase currently deals with data cleaning and exploratory data analysis of the above dataset.
